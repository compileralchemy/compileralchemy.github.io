i have the impression that linked-in is just another social media. the difference is that people wear suits and look for jobs. this is used to hide the fact that they still share cats videos, viral gadgets, wishes, links, comment, like, retweet❌ reshare posts, congratulate each other, write on their wall❌ give recommendations and update their status.

of course having a doctorate assumes that you are actually certified to do those.

don't forget that installing the app guarantees you a genuine whatsapp notification experience. you have also a linked-in lite app, so that users of skype-lite and messenger-lite feel at home.

the story does not stop there. since annoying pms come from tie-wearing individuals, they are called 'offensive recruiters' and persons seeking 'mutual benefits'.

you have your friends❌ connections, you can scroll your feed. you see their activities, they see yours. but of course it's more the academic type, so marketers propose the article post-like feature. you also fill in your fb info of where you went to school and work, just it's really in depth. the same thing you'd complain hashtag#sweat on fb but here you complete it all even if you must take 3 days. though i agree you deserve that badge for the hard work.

it's his birthday, congratulate him. he just planted his first rose, wave at him. he made 3 years at companyY, please keep our site alive by telling him at least a word.

wait ... don't load your page that fast, let our ads load first. and here is your cloak, don't forget to wear it so that users must pay to see who viewed them. hide and seek for adults.

welcome to linked-in.

If you are considering a change in career for whatever reason, the coding industry might be the answer. Your current job might be fulfilling, you might travel around the world at your heart's content, your pay might be more than comfortable, but, the coding industry might still be more charming.

Maybe you are thinking of economic investment. Reinvesting 4 years of tertiary education might not be too attractive. But you can get through for free. A career in coding is mystical, strange. The only requirements are three:

- A desire to learn
- A desire to master
- The love of building things

Yes, you can learn alongside your day job. I've stopped counting the number of waiters and delivery guys who made a jump for the better. Prepare your leap and you land in a completely different land, it is as though you took a shortcut that conventional path won't allow.

You have to see what you are fascinated with. Have websites always amazed you? or is it mobile apps or desktop softwares? You feel, you go.

Next thing is to find a path, you don't want to repeat learning things. You don't want to learn without applying your knowledge. Choose the best tutorials. Consult with someone experienced, ask them to draft a path for you.
