When talking about documentation, people often refer to the end-user experience. However, when things go wrong internally, the end-users don't have a clue on how to solve it.

It is not only necessary to state the how of things. But the why and rationale also. It's a pleasure to read well-documented code, for sure. But, if you have 100Ks of lines, it's not enough.

There are various techniques to document internals. If ever I am doing it, I'd explain:

- The what and why of the project, including the context
- A conceptual overview of the project
- An internal overview
- Techniques to achieve features
- Codebase layout in brief

Current documentation advice is like people advising on how to write good books. But, you always deal with libraries. Sure, you can start shelf by shelf until you find the book you are looking for and get an overview of the library along the way. But, if you need a particular book, it makes sense to have a catalog so that you know what book exists and a library layout, enabling you to navigate your way to the book. Once you get to the book, of course, you'd relish a well-written book.

Documentation is a time investment you make to save someone else's time. People often say that you should not invest too much in the docs as when changing code, it takes time to re-write the docs and sometimes it slogs you down. True. But, documenting the internals as well as techniques used is not mirrored at the code-line level. It's a high-level explanation to get an idea of how things are achieved. This way you can replace a whole code section if needed.

At the end of the day, it's about enabling users to use the product as if you cannot support them. Imagine launching some people on a planet, for one year, with no outside contact. You'd like to produce documentation that is self-reliant as far as possible. It's about giving more power to your users.

The ​Google Developer Experts​ is a thoroughly useless program (except for Google, of course). The people in the program are great enough without this nugatory marketing scheme. They dazzle you with flights to events etc which does not happen for most GDEs.

I never gave GDE much thought as you just don't become a sellout to boost a for-profit company's influence for free. A company that indoctrinates you into believing you are doing pro-bono work for the community. When a great friend proposed that I apply for the GDE program, I considered the request and invested one week to build a case for it. I was trying to lay down footholds to support my decision that it was indeed worth it. But sadly enough, I could not find in the GDE members' own experiences, grounds to support my decision.

GDE is like freemasonry. You cannot apply, a member must contact you. This should tip people that something strange is afoot. You can have high standards, but, let the doors open. It's a way for them to also identify their best fishermen and target them more.

Another thing is that they also look for influence within the community. In addition to technical expertise, you need to be already speaking at events, publishing content, mentoring, and advising others. They need to ensure that you will be able to pump down Google's marketing through enough throats; hooks, sinks, and lines. And oh, if you don't qualify yearly, you'll have your fisherman license removed.

In sum, you need to be already great to be part of a program that uses you to promote its products and services and give you access to relevant events and resources for you to be able to do your job better. It also gives you exclusive access to other fishermen so that you can fish better.

It is your responsibility as a developer to prevent initiatives like the GDE from wrapping people up. We must allow all companies to be the corporate-as-community entity. Since we cannot, we must give the privilege to none. The community is the community. Sure Google can have a community of its own experts. But, the GDE program also includes OpenSource and machine learning for example even if they don't have a direct link to specific Google products.

We do need corporations but as community sponsors. Not that the corporation becomes the community. GDE is not like Microsoft's MVP program where you are recognized for your work in relation to the company's products. This one tries to pass Google as a community evaluator with a title branded under its own banner, not even a community-focused title.

We don't need Google, the privacy freak's validation to be expert developers. And we need to keep Google and its fake tech-agnostic sugar-coated goodwill at bay. We must purge the community from economic foxes and keep the community spirit untainted. You can be great without Google and noble if you refuse to be corrupted and tempted by its economic lures.

Google's nose dive further accentuates after the maze in the mouse saga 11 months ago. In a scathing take, senior staff engineer Diane Hirsh Theriault describes the soulless state Google find itself in.

She writes:

\"My hot take: Google does not have one single visionary leader. Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed. 

Google has not launched one single successful executive-driven thing in years. Sometimes, VPs try to decree \"we need a new chat app or AI-first demo for I/O!\" There's a huge death march, and in the end, the thing is half-baked and roundly derided. If it doesn't get 100 million users in six months, they give up and shut it down. It's like that joke algorithm I learned about in college -- BogoSort. In each iteration of the algorithm, you reorder everything randomly and if the elements happen to land in order, you are done. 

Some of Google's executives are competent referees. I couldn't name which, but I feel like I've seen it done in my 8+ years. They point in a direction, their subordinates swarm the area, try a bunch of stuff, and sometimes something sticks and is cool. 

Right now, all of these boring, glassy-eyed leaders are trying to point in a vague direction (AI) while at the same time killing their golden goose. Given that they have no real vision of their own, they really need their subordinates to come up with cool stuff for them. And at the same time, there have been rolling layoffs for the past 6-12 months throughout the company, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, SRE, everything. Just randomly firing people, torching institutional knowledge, and blowing up perfectly functional teams. 

...

There is a pervasive sense of nihilism that has taken hold. \"Well, I guess I will just do the job until they fire me.\" A lot of people have golden handcuffs situations and aren't going to walk away from the salary, but nobody works late anymore. The buildings are half empty at 4:30. I know a lot of people, myself included, who used to happily do extra work evenings and weekends to get the demo done or just out of boredom. That's gone. 

Google really was a magical place, not very long ago. And for some reason, executives are cashing out their human capital at the very moment it seems to me like they really need it. Who can be dawn-of-a-new-era-of-humanity creative in this environment of fear? It's really sad. I have no way to align myself with any unspoken VP strategy or do good enough work to save myself if my whole team is cut. So I guess I will just hang around and do my job until Google no longer wants me.\"

Linus Benedict Torvalds started Linux as an educational project to learn more about the i386 microprocessor. It was based on the educational operating system called Minix. Like many opensource projects, many people have questioned Linus' engineering choices on various topics. Like Jose Crespo mentioned today concerning interrupt handling in RISC-V where they operate in a serial manner where each interrupt is processed sequentially.

But, questioning Linus starts right from the inception of Linux itself by none other than the creator of Minix, Andy Tanenbaum. Minix used a microkernel approach, where the userspace and kernel are separated. Linux used a monolithic approach. Andy told Linus in exasperation that \"While I could go into a long story here about the relative merits of the two designs, suffice it to say that among the people who actually design operating systems, the debate is essentially over. Microkernels have won.\"

Being on the research side of things, Andy labeled Linus' approach as pure misguidance. He accused him of catapulting us back to prehistoric ages: \"LINUX is
a monolithic style system. This is a giant step back into the 1970s. That is like taking an existing, working C program and rewriting it in BASIC. To me, writing a monolithic system in 1991 is a truly poor idea.\" 

And to that Linus agreed. From a theoretical point of view, he chose a bad design, but, he argued, Minix did not implement microkernels correctly. He preferred something that he could make to work well. 

There is always this rift in hashtag#opensource between the original author's wishes and basically everybody else. The original author often has the project's wellness and survival at heart. While people might be quick to judge and point out validly, the original author considers things holistically. A certain way of doing might be better but, the original author might prefer ease of use over doing things the right way. The original author has in addition, the vision behind the product.

But, of course, Linus is mortal. So, how do we keep the original author's vision, intentions, and definition around? It depends on the author, how much he taught about himself to others, and how much of the relationship between himself and the carving process he exposed to the world.

That's why many authors prefer to remain a dictator over the project, to guide the project to their dreams, not to a dream guided by the weathering process of maintainers' majority votes.

Perks flashing on social media no longer works to attract people.

Even employees themselves are no longer deluded, Google is simply free-falling. Not knowing what to do, Google leadership is now simply pushing levers up and down. With harsh, inconsiderate layoffs, it is expected that the creativity and innovation of employees will go down.

Google is no stranger to the AI game. There was a time when Jeff Dean was buying any AI/Neural book he could find and replaced quite a few services with AI. But, the rise of generative AI proved to be a hard blow to Google's business model. The technological shift was of such a magnitude that Google struggled despite its engineering force.

Google is displaying the signs of a lean corporate — one where the company's value is sought in business practices rather than a strong engineering culture.

When a company derives value through engineering, if it seeks value through business practices, will simply tank. When Airbus launched the A320 Neo engine, it led to a series of events, which showed Boeing's disregard for engineering boomerangs back hard.

Airbus decided to launch a 15% more efficient engine, which companies can use to lower their fares. This was so attractive that even American Airlines decided to buy the planes from Europe. This prompted Boeing to work on a competing product. Everybody expected a robust engineering response, one which polishes the American prestige, but, unfortunately, it revealed that the company officially stooped to flying-coffins levels long ago.

Boeing readied the 787-Max as a response. But, soon it became clear that something was wrong as planes crashed. It was revealed that the company had changed from being an engineer's paradise to a hotbed of sheer incompetence. Probes into the company revealed that even employees did not trust to fly their families on Boeing planes. The shift started when Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas, a company rooted in General Electric's (GE) management style. The merger found Boeing's key staff being replaced by cut-throat business-minded people. Within 2 years, under the pretense of cost-saving, the R&D budget was cut by a staggering 60%. Then the usual patterns of other cost cuts appear, including the selling of plants and firing of people, including its most valuable assets. \"If you hire a team that you think is really good and they’re performing well, why in the hell would you eliminate 10 percent every year?\"

Before the 787-Max, the Dreamliner, a plane produced under the draconian leadership was plagued with quality issues due to replacing quality with cost at each turn. Continuing under the same tone, the 787-Max design was influenced by cash flow more than everything else. They developed great, efficient engines that were too big and had to be refitted further up the wings. This resulted in a change in the centre of gravity which could be solved by the expensive change in tail design. Instead, they found a cheaper alternative by programming the software of the board computer to automatically push the nose of the airplane down by moving the small horizontal stabilizer wing at the back. This relied on unreliable sensors, which Boeing tried hard to hide from regulators and escaped expensive fixes to the system as more and more problems emerged. Pilots in turn could not find anything to help them when erratic behaviours emerged leading to fatal crashes.

Even after two 787-Max crashed, the company was hailed as a true dividend rockstar. But, as with the Dreamliner, increasing production rates increased further quality defects leading to backlogs and canceled contracts. The net result was that eventually, Boeing asked the government for a 60 billion USD bailout, the amount it spent on buybacks and dividends between 2013 and 2019.

It's a grossly inefficient system, that is falling apart, failing its moral duties, and filled with bureaucracy. By shackling educators to copy-paste policies from abroad, the sincere ones among them now silently, every day, mourn the last days of a zombie.

Knowing teachers of laureates, it is surprisingly not a matter of superior intelligence, just like rocket scientists and brain surgeons [1]. It is rather a change in study methodology.

The general school life is one where family ties are blasted to bits and moral education is left to the wind. It's one where a social animal is reduced to a trained robot, tied to a legal leash. It's one where time is a luxury and paradise is promised after work. With tuition, students are tortured mentally, physically, financially, and, ironically, cognitively. 

People sacrifice life skills for A-level success. A success that stops at the university door. Then it's completely out of your life. You won't see it twice.

At the end of the cycle, it seems, and I hope I am wrong, that students in colonies and former colonies end up like guided minions, aligning their dishes with Paris, ready to receive, with eagerness, whatever their overlords over there will beam.

Make no mistakes dear friends, I eat tartine in the morning: sliced baguette, with butter, jam, and even marmelade. I enjoy all sorts of coffee and even special cheese at the end of meals. I speak French, needless to say. But, this does not mean that I have an internalized over-glorification of France in my mind. I don't see la métropole as the epitome of perfection at each turn of the conversation.

My French friends even refer to the French educational system as \"éducation nationale pourrie\". But, people from outside France see it as the world's beacon. Injected with France's gloriole and dependent on a specific setting, they cannot fathom further studies away from the hive. 

Oftentimes I see our neighbors in Reunion comment on the uncultured Mauritians on the net. As the French system teaches art and biased, polarised philosophy, brainwashed products look down upon other people. People can study silly topics for long enough, develop respect for people producing silliness, and listen to people certifying silliness as grand, it is their wish. As for people who don't worship crap, they congratulate themselves on the lack of it in their lives.

As a way to dissolve surrounding societal structures, students of the system are taught l'analyse critique, to rethink, and question assumptions. A critical and inquisitive mind should also be used on France, its beloved educational system, how it maintains itself as one of the world's top weapon exporters, how it still derives its power and influence, and the horrifying, despicable, shamelessly bloody, forever stained history behind gifting this educational system to various parts of the world.

Once I proposed to include the French flag in the French README of the Python docs. The main maintainer did not want to. He said that French is the language of people speaking French, around the globe and not the exclusivity of France. It's good to see people maintaining an inclusive spirit and putting everyone on the same pedestal. People in the French system outside of France in contrast see it as their duty-bound mission to roll out their tongues as the red carpet on which French icons tread as haughty aristocrats.

I sincerely hope that regular trips and activities and rigourous standards are not treated as grounds to preach with pride.

\"I feel that there's a subtle question that is not answered though - what are the characteristics of a good educational system and why?\" Well, do we need education or do we need an educational system? When there is mass production, a natural occurrence is rejects. Now, when mass-producing animate products, the trauma is upon life.

Since education is done through a system that everyone has to pass through, and that too for a decade, it ensures that everybody has the same treatment for a long time. This contrasts with the diversity of human profiles. Unfortunately, people can't be molded into perfect, finished robots as they won't give up part of their profile to fit the system's vision. Many people just switch off their receiving end and cruise through the system without absorbing anything.

With the system in place, it has become like a robust funnel. Whatever ill there is in the society, it ends up through school friends in a person's life. There is no need to wait for people selling hazardous products on the streets to initiate students. Friends and regrettably now, teachers sell health-damaging products on school premises. Even if a student only goes to school and back home, with no additional trips, it is sufficient to lead a broken life. It is happening around us. This is why today it's a shivering statement to put the educational system as one of society's worst ills. We hope it's not the worst evil as it's mandatory, compound, and severely damaging.

Is it good to keep dogs in cages with some food during the day and release them at night? I don't know about dogs but surely I think that keeping human beings in cages from 08:00 to 14:30 with some food and then back into the cages again until dusk is bound to routinely erupt. Maybe some people like it but not all. Man is a social, physical creature that ensures its survival by moving around. The system of forcing everyone to sit on a chair for hours on end is bound to generate hate and dissidence.

Educational systems view books as a fundamental teaching tool. It has to be the focal laughingstock of contemporary pedagogy to feed books to children as early as 6 years of age. Man is intelligent, curious, and understands quickly. But, forcing pages down the throats of youngsters shows the superimposition of an adult mind on the workings of a nascent organism.

An educational system, if there is one, should serve the needs of society. With the current one, society bends to the whims of the system. Responsible parties plan their daily schedule and yearly plans according to an inherited system that obliterates the individual and was not conceived to help society achieve its goals.

We need education, but not an indiscriminate educational system. There is a mandatory part of education that should be imparted. Education should also be centered around man, not the movement of matter. Home is the first school. We should cater according to desire. And we surely don't need an overdose of education.

There is a difference between man's child and that of animals. A man's child is not ready to hit the road straight out of birth. Its functional abilities reach a stable level years later. During this time and after, care should be devoted to upbringing. They should be inculcated with great values, awareness of their environment, and social skills.

The current educational system has set education as a teen's life goal. Its curriculum is filled with everything but what relates to man's upbringing. Parents should bring up the child I hear you say, but, the system takes up so much time that no time is left for upbringing. And it sucks so much energy that a child is drained when reaching home. And this sick routine as early as 3 years of age, holidays included.

Is the curriculum geared toward financial success? No, it does not teach about economics as a foundational topic or managing money or wealth creation or studying how people hit millions and billions. It seems tailor-made for people to be employees. And people think that it's good to excel in a system that is preparing you to work hard for someone's else economic success.

Education also includes practice. If in pursuing 'education' you never respected elders, then you were never educated in terms of respect. 

To excel in a system, you need to devote focus, time, and energy. You invested so much in a system that leaves you deprived of good moral grounding and excellent human character. You take care to prepare for exams as you know great results don't materialize out of thin air, but, you rely on society's hazy hangover to become a wholesome human.

As the educational system completely does not care about man and his standard of life, it's the responsibility of parents to ensure that family ties are maintained, that cooperation exists in a society, that a child returns good for the bad, is altruistic, and knows about good and evil. To do that, if we have to invest less in an educational system, it's worth it.

If we don't invest in man to become good, material investment will turn out to be wasteful or harmful. People in control of powerful technologies will be selfish and people, while abandoning their upbringing for 'education', turn rogues, will demolish the very advanced infrastructure everyone has been working to further. 

Good, wholesome and competent people bring out good, wholesome and competent systems.

When parents prepare food for their children in the morning before going to school, they are in fact raising vicious vipers that will bleed their hearts many times in the future. When parents click pause on all life activities and dedicate their children solely to the altar of the current educational system, they are breeding compassless, apathetic, stress-drowned, morally derelict, and dangerously feral creatures that bite the hands of their feeders first and foremost.

We identify trees by their fruits. The current educational system produces what kind of human beings exactly? Students act like properly untamed and uncouth individuals. They display a complete lack of manners in class, trying their utmost to render the life of educators hell. They engage in hair-raising behaviors outside of classrooms. They do exactly what they want. If ever teachers or anyone try to stop them, their windshields get shattered or recently, they just get beaten by a mob outside school. These are routine occurrences. Everybody just leaves them to the sacred job of rotting their lives further.

The current system takes it upon itself to break the bond between parents and children. From an early age, children are made to attend time-filling sessions filled with gibberish rather than stay with their parents. Parents entrust their children to be reared by the population's children, which gets progressively atrocious. Back home they have to deal with children raised by others. It's heart-burning to see children, as a direct consequence of going to school, treating parents like dirt.

The whole track is designed for these ungrateful goblins to be financially dependent on their parents for years on end. Tolerating and absorbing their constant deep clawing, parents hope that one day they will realize and reflect on their behavior once they get a job. They also hope that they just won't forget them, especially if they took loans to fund university. But, how many morally-deprived children do we hear just disappear abroad after studies?

People were dependent on society's good morality to reflect on the system. But, with the nuking of the concept of morality globally, coupled with the babysitting of kids by the internet, no parenting safety net exists. You have to be good at parenting against a system that tries hard to rot your children. It's like dipping clothes forcefully in the mud then trying to wash them and so on for one whole year.

Parents who have been through the system unbelievably forget about its darkness. Like birds breaking free, the newly found freedom makes them forget their time in cages. They send their children to school once again, stupidly hoping that the coolness of their eyes will turn out to be all right without any upbringing.

Needless to say, seeing the thankless, repulsive, demoniac attitude of children, people don't want to have kids. This in turn leads to bodies begging people to rejuvenate a constantly aging population.

The educational system offers flat poor role models. Many of the people glorified snugly fit into the depths of the dustbin of relevance. Though the system ditches the human side of things, it bizarrely glorifies scientists and mathematicians. These fleeting references to humans in a human system are a joke to human values and the selections are oftentimes inadequate in relation to the field itself.

It's great time that Pythagoras and Euclid are booted hard out of textbooks and buried deep in the graveyard of embarrassment. Who was Euclid? We simply don't know[1]. Was Elements written by Euclid? On Part 1 Definition 1, you can read "This definition may or may not have been in Euclid’s original Elements. Many parts of the Elements have been added since the original version. Indeed, all of the formatter including the definitions, common notions, and postulates may have been added after Euclid." [2]. A literal shame to be in a textbook. Unless it's for showing the superiority of a culture rather than objective, efficient study.

Pythagoras is another pitiful disaster. "It is difficult to distinguish Pythagoras’s teachings from those of his disciples. Pythagoras himself likely wrote no books, and Pythagoreans invariably supported their doctrines by indiscriminately citing their master’s authority. ..., and the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles) were probably developed only later by the Pythagorean school. More probably, the bulk of the intellectual tradition originating with Pythagoras himself belongs to mystical wisdom rather than to scientific scholarship." [3]. No comments are needed.

A great, relevant embodiment of this whole circus should have been Von Neumann. Students should have been taught his life as the personification of this whole saga. He was a beautiful avatar of the system: a dazzling employee, excelling in studies, inventing lots of stuff, and accomplishing the goals of the state brilliantly. He was a mega master of disciplines. But, he is surprisingly missing in high school textbooks.

Von Neumann knew disciplines as we do now, not some primitive field figure. He was into extensive maths, quantum physics, computer science, and even chemistry. If there were Nobel prizes in his time for maths, computers, and economics, he would have won those. The last genius put his knowledge to modern butchery, being the leading mathematician in shaped charges, contributing significantly to the atomic bomb, and overseeing calculations as to death tolls, detonation distance, and blast radius of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was also a founding father of the hydrogen bomb. He won the Presidential Medal of Freedom for these works. In his last days, worried about the afterlife, he accepted Christianity.

This is your life story. Excelling in studies with no life aim, being a brilliant employee, furthering the immoral aims of nations, winning freedom medals, and then pondering reality as death looms. Don't be the next Von Neumann.

It's a jaw-dropping fact to note that despite a humanistic-dominating worldview across countries, the educational system has exhibited a remarkable degree of impermeability in teaching good human character. 

Some nice-to-have human principles are appreciated universally. When children respect parents for example. Or being helpful, maintaining good relationships, feeding the poor, being honest, sticking to agreements, not cheating in business, acting the best with family members, being truthful, caring for the orphans, and joining together to accomplish the same. Nowadays, even the very basics are in need of dissemination due to erosion and re-questioning.

It is not sufficient to delegate the responsibility to intuition to arrive at these qualities. Man forgets often and needs to be reminded. Enough reminders are an encouragement to shift the balance, forging parts of the personality. This formation should be shared by everybody. Parents at home, friends we hang out with, colleagues we work with, and strangers on the street.

Society currently relies on randomness to produce good citizens. After passing through the educational system, people took from the good like a leaking basket, feeding themselves a miser's meal. Then people complain when rulers are corrupt, the administration is inefficient, partners cheat more than enough even in open relationships, traders sting and we are apathetic to hunger. 

People are ready to blame a decaying society, including health on everything except what they sowed with their hands. Schools are your regional tavern, gambling house, drug den, whore house, and chamber of horrors all in one. People in my country should verify these statements one by one. Setting foot in even one of these places is sufficient to be doomed. This means that a child is surrounded by drunkards, gamblers, drug addicts, whores, and psychological abusers. To come even clean is a miracle.

We follow people we take as friends. Bad companionship is like hanging out with a blacksmith. Even if sparks don't burn your clothes, you and your clothes will drink smoke and stink. 

It's the individual responsibility of everybody to share good advice. If humans are good, society will be a nice place to live and people will look forward to living. Else people will envy the inhabitants of graves if only they were friends with them instead of living with arc-demons in a hellish reality.
