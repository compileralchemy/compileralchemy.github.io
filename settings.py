I worked with Abdur at Metabob and when he came in he was able to lead our team in terms of having a proper system design to documentation. He was able to make the engineering team more productive than it was before. If you are looking for an engineer who is strong technically he is the one that can do it. His experience with open source is one of the biggest plus he has bought to the team.

        'text': '''I worked with Abdur-Rahmaan's on one of his many open source software project, Shopyo. As this was my first time contributing to open source, I was not very confident in my skills. However, Abdur-Rahmaan was very patient and helped with the process of project setup and contribution. Looking back since my first open source contribution, I couldn't have asked for a better mentor than Abdur-Rahmaan. As I worked more with him, I learned that he has a vast knowledge not only of software engineering but also possess excellent communication and leadership skills. His attention to details, clear guidance, pursuit of best industry practices, and past experience and success in managing a team of engineers makes him a great leader
and asset to any team.<br><br>

As if this was not enough, he also possess the gift of being artistic and creative, 
with the ability to make software not only functional but also marketable with design 
skills that he pursues as a hobby.<br><br>

His work in both professional and open source setting speaks itself but this recommendation is just a token of appreciation on behalf of countless engineers whom he has helped improve and break into the open source community. I wish him the best in his future endeavors and I am excited to see where his work takes him.'''

This podcast features two Pypy and one CPython core devs. Projects like Pypy and CPython are complex undertakings. Even to start contributing, 
people are intimidated. As maintainers of such projects, the amount of knowledge 
accumulated over the years is just huge. This episode explores the history and evoltion of Pypy.
It debunks the myth of it's difficult to contribute to Pypy. It covers efforts undertaken to
help people get initiated and progress. We also get to listen to Bahutan's own experience of 
being onboarded to the Pypy project. It also contrasts the Pypy experience with the CPython one.
You also get a lots of Pythonista gems along the way.
A dream podcast for me!
