Visited great friends in the Silicon Valley sometime back. Putting a brief guide if you want to visit it.

The Silicon Valley is that area of California where many big tech companies are headquartered. Even if they are not HQ'ed over there, companies maintain at least an office, like MS, Amazon and Tesla. 

It's capital is San Jose, San Francisco is also well known. The Silicon Valley is an unofficial name designating the bay area. 

Of interest are two famous universities: Berkeley and Stanford. The Golden gate bridge is a popular landmark.

The main attraction of the area is the concentrated pool of talents that it hosts and the crazy amount of advances that occurs as a result.

From SF through San Mateo until Sunnyvale, it forms a straight line, where the companies are not located too far.

The most famous airport, the San Francisco one, is south of SF. The airport is super well designed, with minimal time for entering and exiting.

I went there through United Airlines as the Spirit website never worked for me.

I will cover many aspects of the journey in upcoming posts. 

Hope it helps!

San Francisco or SF as it is commonly referred to, is one of technocracy's icons, the seat of several unicorns and the source of constant inspiration to utopians.

It's THE tech city where most ads, billboards and busses feature tech ads. Vercel is advertised like Pepsi.

And it's beautiful. The part where people don't build high-rise buildings host stylish 2-storey houses, with well-trimmed bushes and raised front door with some 20-step stairs.

It's also advertises the highest business taxes in the whole Bay area. A large Pizza costs $30.

You can go around the city via Uber, metro or bus. I paid Uber $35 from the airport. You can also use scooter-like contraptions to move around the city to save you some walk.

You can listen to tech-aware places buzz with Ai while sipping coffee. Halal food of all kind is found in abundance near or around mosques. 

There is also the weird part of SF, where you can experience cyberpunk reality. You breathe the pulse of innovation while walking past brain-fried drug addicts moving like zombies, and invisible to the living like decorative pot plants. 

There's also the Tenderloin where, i had the unfortunate chance of visiting while following the directions of an OpenStreet app. It's that part which looks desolate, smells literally of urine and features homeless people. However, if you are willing to brave the stench and dÃ©cor, you find the cheapest good-quality food and housing of SF.

SF is worth visiting for it's places of interest, people and world-class events. 

Thanks to the Metabob team, Axel LÃ¶nnfors, Avinash Gopal and Massimiliano Genta for making my stay an unforgettable experience ðŸ‘Œ

San Jose is the political center of the SV and frankly, i did not know about it until i decided to meet some folks. It's pronounced San HosÃ©

It is an iconic place, for sure. It's like tech world's nexus. Travelling through you can see that AMD and Intel actually face each other, separated by the motorway. You can also see the court where Amy Winehouse was convicted and the ruling of Oracle vs Google was given, again, from the motorway.

The whole point of visiting was to attend a meetup of the BayPiggies, one of the bay area UGs. The other two are SF Python and Pyninsula. It was held in the Cambrian library. Thankful to the organizers for giving me an impromptu slot to talk about OpenSource, the Pallets, PyCons sprint and Pallets-eco. 

One highlight was attending a talk by Joel Dodson who is blind, presenting about Python and React and accessibility. Impressive. Got a chance to meet other cool folks like Karen Dalton, Chris Brousseau and Darlene Wong who keep the UG going. 

It was an amazing pleasure to meet Mahmoud Hashemi, author of Enterprise Python! He showed me around, made me discover local foods like a gignastic pepper stuffed with cheese and red sauce*. We had interesting deeply insightful conversations about tech and OpenSource.

Also met with Muhammad Hasan, Staff Eng at Google with a nice LinkedIn following and Nathan Hickson, who had a rich career working for many Faang-like companies, from Apple, LinkedIn, Google, Netflix, Ebay etc. Will post brief interview notes with these folks later on.

I lacked time, could not visit more.

Pictures: Adobe headquarters, random mall near the station you hop off if you want to visit Google TM2, Relleno, the oldest house in SJ ...

Will post about transportation next.

*Mahmoud: It was a Chile Relleno. Notably it's usually a pablano pepper which has thinner walls, but a basic version can be made at home with green bell pepper
